        <h4>How to connect to an ANT+ peripheral</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Insert the ANT+ Wahoo Key into the 30-pin connector of your iPhone to connect to ANT+ peripherals</li>
            <li>Activate your sensor and touch the connect button on the screen of your iPhone. Some weight scales might need a wake up command to start up. To send that push the "Send Profile" button first, to wake it up, and then the connect button to connect to it</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h4>Troubleshooting</h4>
        
        <p><strong>The ANT+ Wahoo Key is inserted but not recognized!?!</strong></p>
        
        <p>This issue is almost always cause by dust, lint or other debris in the 30-pin connector. Syncing your iPhone only uses a few pins compared to the ANT+ Wahoo Key connector, so successful syncing and charging does not mean your connector is not contaminated. Cleaning the 30-pin connector with a cotton swab or canned air should fix this issue.</p>
