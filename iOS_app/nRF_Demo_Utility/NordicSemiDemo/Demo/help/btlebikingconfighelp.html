        <h4>COMMON SENSOR INFO</h4>
         
		<h4>Proximity</h4>
        <p>When set to ON, enables proximity pairing. Default is OFF.</p>
        
        <h4>Wildcard</h4> 
        <p>When set to ON, enables iPhone to connect to unpaired devices (devices not in the Manage Connections list). Default is OFF.</p>
        
        <h4>Dev ID</h4>
        <p>Returns the Device ID of the connected sensor.</p>
        
        <h4>Signal Eff</h4>
        <p>Returns the signal efficiency for the connected sensor.
        <ul><li>For ANT connections, this property represents the ratio of messages received from the sensor over the number of messages expected (range [0, 1.0]). This value should give a good indication of the reception quality for the sensor.</li>
            <li>For BT Smart connections, this property represents the RSSI (in dBm). If the sensor is not currently connected, the return value is -1.</li></ul>
        </p>
        
        <h4>Sensor Info</h4>
        <p>Information about the sensor connected.</p>      

		<h4>Manage Connections</h4>
        <p>List of paired devices. To delete a paired device from the list swipe left on the right hand side of the screen and press Delete.</p>
        
        <h4>HEART RATE INFO</h4>
        
        <h4>beatCount</h4>
        <p>A single byte value which increments with each heart beat event. This value will roll over every 255 counts.</p>
        
        <h4>beatTime</h4>
        <p>Represents the time of the last valid heart beat event. The time units are 1/1024 seconds. Since the values are stored in two byte integers which have a maximum value of 65536, the value will roll over at 64 seconds (65536 / 1024). This should be taken into consideration when determining the currency of the data.</p>
        
 		<h4>prevBeat</h4>
        <p>Represents the time of the previous valid heart beat event.</p>
	    
        <h4>BIKE SPEED/CADENCE INFO</h4>
        
		<h4>Odometer</h4>
        <p>Odometer information from the SPD/CAD sensor</p>
		
        <h4>lastCadenceTime</h4>
        <p>Represents the time of the last valid cadence event. The time units are 1/1024 seconds. Since the values are stored in two byte integers which have a maximum value of 65536, the value will roll over at 64 seconds (65536 / 1024). This should be taken into consideration when determining the currency of the data.</p>
        
        <h4>totalCadenceRevolutions</h4>
        <p>byte integer which has a maximum value of 65536, the value will roll over at 65536 revolutions. This should be taken into consideration when making calculations.</p>
        
        <h4>lastSpeedTime</h4>
        <p>Represents the time of the last valid speed event. The time units are 1/1024 seconds. Since the values are stored in two byte integers which have a maximum value of 65536, the value will roll over at 64 seconds (65536 / 1024). This should be taken into consideration when determining the currency of the data.</p>
        
        <h4>totalSpeedRevolutions</h4>
        <p>Represents the total number of wheel revolutions. Since the value is stored in a two byte integer which has a maximum value of 65536, the value will roll over at 65536 revolutions. This should be taken into consideration when making calculations.</p>

        <h4>Ambient Temperature</h4>
        <p>The abient temperature of the SPD/CAD sensor</p>
